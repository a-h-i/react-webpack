React Webpack
=============

My own personalized template for a react webpack project.

I basically took the hellow world app I wrote while learning react a while back, and rewrote it using my own webpack setup so that I can debug and build it along the way. Tailoring it to my needs. 

Of course as I develop additional react projects, the build system will grow to acommodate my needs. Similary to what happened to my Angular-Gulp template. Such updates will be reflected in this project's build system and configuration in a generic method.

Note that this isn't a generator nor meant to be cloned as a starting point. 
More like a reference, copy the config files, install the packages (with updated version don't just copy paste package.json so that npm can install latest version) and so forth.


Check package.json for scripts.
